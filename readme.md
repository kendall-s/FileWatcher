## Context

This app is incredibly simplistic, mainly so less-tech-savy individuals can hopefully use the application. Parameterisation of copying files is kept at the absolute minimum for the sake of keeping it simple.

There is certainly the possibility to add a keywords or regex type search to the file finding, perhaps even by size or by time. For now, the file watcher serves its purpose. âœŒ

ðŸ“Š Used the rich library to make the terminal a little bit nicer. Might build on this feature in the future if necessary.
